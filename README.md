Hello, I am a cybersecurity aficionado.
I have a combination of hands-on work experience and extensive classroom studies in the field of cybersecurity.
I have completed two internships, one as a Cybersecurity Analyst for a small consulting firm, and another as an Information Security Intern for an early stage social media startup.
I am finishing up my Master of Science Degree in Cybersecurity at Fordham University where I have achieved a 3.975 GPA, become a member of the honors society, and Iâ€™m ranked in the top 10% of my class.
In the spring of 2021 I competed in a Cyber Capture the Flag event and placed in the top third in individual competitions.
Currently, I am working as a Teaching Assistant at a Cybersecurity bootcamp where I am sharing my cybersecurity knowledge and experience with adults who want to break into the field.
Cybersecurity is a subject matter that I love and I can often be found listening to cybersecurity podcasts or reading content from various technology and cyber publications in my spare time.
I have completed projects and have experience in the following: python programming, bash scripting, cryptography, intrusion detection, penetration testing, network hardening and security, digital forensics, incident response, threat intelligence, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, asset management, web development, web vulnerabilities and hardening, and log analysis among others.
