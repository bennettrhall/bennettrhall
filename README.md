I am a cybersecurity aficionado. I have a combination of hands-on work experience and extensive classroom studies in the field of cybersecurity. I have my Master of Science Degree in Cybersecurity from Fordham University where I have achieved a 3.975 GPA, become a member of the honors society, and ranked in the top 10% of my class. In the spring of 2021 I competed in a Cyber Capture the Flag event and placed in the top third in individual competitions. Cybersecurity is a subject matter that I love and I can often be found listening to cybersecurity podcasts or reading content from various technology and cyber publications in my spare time.
